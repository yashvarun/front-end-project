# 👨‍💻 Personal Portfolio Website

A modern, high-performance portfolio website designed for a Healthcare Consultant & Business Analyst. This project features a minimalist aesthetic with advanced visual effects, built entirely using **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks required).

## ✨ Key Features

* **Generative Background:** A custom HTML5 Canvas animation simulating a flowing "Silk" effect with organic sine waves and noise.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Service cards feature a frosted glass effect using `backdrop-filter: blur()`, semi-transparent backgrounds, and subtle borders.
* **Scroll Reveal Animations:** Elements gracefully slide up and fade in as the user scrolls down the page using the `IntersectionObserver` API.
* **Text Effects:** Headlines feature a staggered "Blur Word" entry animation for a cinematic introduction.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully adaptive layout that switches from a grid to a single column on mobile devices.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom variables, Grid/Flexbox, and advanced animations (keyframes, transitions).
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** Logic for the Canvas animation, intersection observers, and DOM manipulation.
